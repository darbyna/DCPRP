              <p style="color: white;  text-align: justify;"> 
                  <br>
                  COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) is a respiratory virus that has the capability to cause pneumonic symptoms and death amongst patients. Thus far, in the United States of America there have been over 650K deaths during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Confounding factors such as pollutants can have an effect on the rate of illness amongst infectants. In this particular study, we will be examining the pollutant known as particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a carcinogen that is known to cause epigenetic and genetic alterations that can lead to severe illness. Majority of the illnesses that derive from particulate matter 2.5 are respiratory and cardiovascular based. This is significant since COVID-19 also affects the respiratory and cardiovascular sectors of conspecifics. Rather high concentrations of particulate matter 2.5 have been witnessed in several sectors of the United States of America. We examined the influx of particulate matter 2.5 in the Washington, DC area during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to alternative pollutants. Our hypothesis was supported that our predictive model of Particulate Matter 2.5 concentrations should decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic and that there will be an increase during the re-opening of the economy in late 2020 and 2021 onward. The PRPUI analyzer was also constructed as a front-end user-interface for analyzing different pollutants.

                  <br>
                  COVID-19 (Sars-COV-2) is a pneumonic-based respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has led to a pandemic with over six-hundred fifty thousand deaths in the United States of America and over four million deaths globally. This virus has been observed to have major effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of infectants (Aveyard et al. 2021; Ebinger et al. 2020; Clerkin et al. 2020; Bansal, 2020 ). Symptoms of COVID-19 include tussis, fatigure, fibrous aches, pyrexia or chills, or more (Aveyard et al. 2021; Ebinger et al. 2020; Clerkin et al. 2020; Bansal, 2020 ). Individuals with pre-existing disorders such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, or respiratory disorders are considered at-risk as they are more prone to fatality via COVID-19 (Aveyard et al. 2021; Ebinger et al. 2020; Clerkin et al. 2020; Bansal, 2020 ). With COVID-19 mutating and thus having multiple variant iterations, the virus will continue to become more potent and cause more deaths across the globe. Unfortunately, not only will the novel variants of COVID-19 lead to omnipotency, but confounding factors such as pollutant concentrations will as well. In this manuscript, we will focus primarily on the respiratory aspects of COVID-19 by observing trends of the common pollutant known as Particulate Matter 2.5 and other confounding pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Particulate Matter 2.5 is a particle that is less than 2.5 micrometers large (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). Particulate Matter 2.5 commonly derives from automobiles, construction, and deforestation (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). This particular pollutant can cause major health disorders within conspecifics upon inhalation (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). Disorders that arise from particular matter 2.5 exposure includes lung cancer and other respiratory disorders (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). Particulate matter 2.5 has been observed to have major effects on conspecifics that have asthma and any alternative respiratory disorders (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). As a result of particulate matter 2.5 being a major contributing factor for respiratory disorders, it is essential to observe how particulate matter 2.5 can affect victims of COVID-19. When conspecifics are exposed to particulate matter 2.5, the transmission of COVID-19 increases significantly (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). Particulate matter 2.5 is a known contributor for the enhanced transmission of COVID-19 (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). In fact, it has been observed that particulate matter 2.5 particles contain COVID-19 viral fragments that can promote the spread of the virus (Keet et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2019; White et al. 2019; Tecer et al. 2008; Comunian et al. 2020; Shafinaz et al. 2021). In essence, not only is particulate matter 2.5 known for promoting oncogenesis, but it can also promote the matriculation of COVID-19. Since particulate matter 2.5 is correlated with increased rates of COVID-19 infection, it is essential to examine the general concentration of PM2.5 during the COVID-19 pandemic and before. This will ultimately allow one to determine the correlations between other pollutants and additional confounding factors - such as COVID-19 mortalities.

                  Resultantly, while observing the trends of COVID-19 throughout the 2019-2020 period, we hypothesize that in the Washington, District of Columbia, area, PM2.5 will show a decrease during the earlier periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the later periods of 2020, the PM2.5 concentrations will begin to increase due to elevated human activity. PM 2.5 concentrations will be observed in relation to alternative pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Sulfur Dioxide within the Washington, D.C. area from the periods of 2015-2020 to procure an accurate depiction of how PM 2.5 altered during the pandemic. PM 2.5 concentrations will correlate with the air quality trends and trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
